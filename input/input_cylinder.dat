20.
dx ratio : expanding mesh ratio. For Gmsh reading option it is not used.
1.
fac:  multiplier to make grids randomly non-uniform; uniform: fac=0
0.
Huyn solver: for now only the option 2 is used which is the DG equivalence
2
time integration: 1: explicit Euler, 2: explicit RK2, 4: explicit RK4
4
advection scheme: 1: original discontinuous, 2: continuous mass flux term
1
problem type. For now, number 1 is the Cavity, 2 is BFS, 3 is flow over cylinder
3 
number of time steps
10000
dt: time step size 
0.0005
dumpfreq: how many time steps are the results saved
100
fast: if it uses large stencil or compact stencil. fast-true means compact. It is not setup yet in the code
